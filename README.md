This repository contains files to generate my static personal website, which will be hosted
on the InterPlanetary File System or [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)
via [Fleek](https://fleek.co/hosting/). The site makes use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
which is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. Template used is called [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/).
