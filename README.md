This repository contains source code to generate my static personal website, which will be hosted
on the InterPlanetary File System or [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/)
via [Fleek](https://fleek.co/hosting/). The site makes use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
which is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. Template used is called 
[Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/anatole/).

You can visit the site [here.](https://vikasnegi.eth.limo/) I also wrote a 
[blog post](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-guide-to-building-your-first-decentralized-website-in-2023-d21c41128e07?source=friends_link&sk=b0003e2a02a9a145e9dbd8a2658a60b1)
describing all the steps in detail.
