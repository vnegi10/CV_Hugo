This static website is hosted on the **InterPlanetary File System** or
[IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) via [Fleek](https://fleek.co/hosting/).
It makes use of the [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) theme in combination
with the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/). I also use an 
[Ethereum Name Service](https://app.ens.domains/name/vikasnegi.eth/details) domain to point
to this site. This is my first attempt at building a web3 based webpage. Needless to say, I
am super excited to explore what this technology has to offer.

Feel free to visit the other tabs on this site, and share some feedback. I would also be
happy to connect professionally via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/negivikas/) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/vnegi10). In case you wish to try out something similar, here
is an excellent [blog](https://dri.es/my-first-web3-webpage) post with detailed steps.
