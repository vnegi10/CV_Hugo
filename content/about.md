I currently work as a Metrology Design Engineer at ASML in the Netherlands. I love coding, and my language of choice is Julia. Besides that, I occasionally tinker with my Raspberry Pi. My other hobbies include listeing to Lex Fridman's podcasts, running and gaming on a custom built PC or Xbox. I am also deeply interested in web3 and blockchain based technologies.
