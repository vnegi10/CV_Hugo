I currently work as a Senior Metrology Design Engineer and Architect at ASML in the Netherlands.
I love coding, and my languages of choice are Julia and Python. Besides that, I try to spend some
time tinkering with hardware in my home lab. My other hobbies include listening to podcasts
(big fan of Lex Fridman) during long walks, running, and watching new shows/documentaries/anime
on Netflix. Chef's Table and Castlevania have been my favorites in recent times.

I am a proud owner of a PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One S. On my PC, I last played the new
Tomb Raider and Doom series. I also enjoy playing couch co-ops (Overcooked, Lovers in a
Dangerous Spacetime, Death Squared, A Way Out etc.) along with my partner on the Xbox.
