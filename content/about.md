I currently work as a Metrology Design Engineer at ASML in the Netherlands. I love coding, 
and my language of choice is Julia. Besides that, I occasionally tinker with my Raspberry Pi.
My other hobbies include listening to podcasts (big fan of Lex Fridman) during long walks, running, 
and watching new shows/documentaries on Netflix. Chef's Table has been my absolute favorite in recent
times.

I am a proud owner of a custom built PC and a Xbox One S. On my PC, I last played the new 
Tomb Raider and Doom series. Doom Eternal was such a blast! I also enjoy playing couch 
co-ops (Overcooked, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, Death Squared, A Way Out etc.) along 
with my partner.
