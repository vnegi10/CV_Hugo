I currently work as a Metrology Design Engineer at ASML in the Netherlands. I love coding, and my language of choice is Julia. Besides that, I occasionally tinker with my Raspberry Pi. My other hobbies include listening to podcasts (big fan of Lex Fridman) during long walks, running and watching new shows/documentaries on Netflix. I am also a proud owner of a custom built PC and a Xbox One S. Whenever time permits, I try to learn more about Web 3.0 and blockchain based technologies.
