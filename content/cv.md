## EXPERIENCE

##### Senior Metrology Design Engineer at ASML | 01/2019 – Present
- Coordinated several projects leading to key software deliveries for ASML's flagship DUV
lithography systems, thus contributing to [2022 net sales](https://www.asml.com/en/investors/annual-report/2022)
of €21.2 billion, gross margin of 50.5%, and net income of €5.6 billion.
- Designed framework for internal software migration to GitHub, set up CI/CD using
GitHub Actions and Artifactory, code quality monitoring using [TIOBE TiCS TQI.](https://www.tiobe.com/products/tics/)
- Responsible for group's MATLAB architecture roadmap, wrote new design documents for
essential software components, supervised timely reviews, and oversaw stakeholder
management.
- Improved cross-functional competence by building knowledge transfer documents and
participating in design reviews
- Independently supported various critical escalations (machine issues) with customers in
Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and France.
- Involved in coaching junior engineers, supervised team participation in multiple
hackathons, part of organization committee for 'DUV Innovation Marketplace' on a department
level.
- Developed and maintained various internal Julia data analysis packages for the ASML
community

##### Eindhoven University of Technology | 06/2014 - 09/2018
- Computational modeling combined with in-house optical experiments to study phase 
separation in organic thin films during spin-coating
- Established and coordinated external collaboration with research groups in Germany,
Russia and United States resulting in three publications.
- Proven track record in computational physics with multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals
- Demonstrated excellent communication skills through talks and posters at various 
international conferences in Europe (ICSM 2014, Turku; HOPV 2018, Benidorm) and Asia (ICSM 2016, Guangzhou)

##### Shell Technology Centre Bangalore | 05/2013 - 02/2014
- Master’s Thesis: Used Density Functional Theory to study methanation on a cobalt catalyst
during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
- Worked in a multi-disciplinary and cross-functional team of material scientists,
computational physicists and geologists.
- Added significant value to computational R&D at Shell, received the highest grade for
master’s thesis based on this work.

##### Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research, Dresden, Germany | 05/2012 - 07/2012
- Received a DAAD scholarship to travel to Germany, and perform cutting-edge experimental
research in a world-leading [laboratory](https://www.ifw-dresden.de/).
- Learned a novel spectroscopy technique involving high-frequency high-magnetic field electron spin resonance in a short period of two months
